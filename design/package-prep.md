# Plan: README Overhaul + License + Launch Readiness Fixes

## Context

Launch readiness audit surfaced 4 blockers and 7 warnings. Remaining
work is README documentation and a license decision.

**Blocker/warning codes from launch readiness audit (this session):**
- **B1:** No license file
- **B2:** README missing unified learning loop explanation
- **B3:** README missing skill invocation docs (handoff-test
  undocumented, secondary skills lack invocation info)
- **B4:** README missing 7 implemented features
- **W3:** README doesn't explain that `hartphoenix/maestro-signals` is
  the developer feedback repo
- **W5:** No troubleshooting section
- **Option B:** Ship signal dispatch as one-way (developer receives
  signals now; teacher response loop ships later). Chosen over
  Option A (defer signals entirely) and Option C (build return path
  before launch).

**One-shot fixes already applied** on branch `hart/yaml-current-state`
(not yet committed):
- Renamed `.claude/feedback.json` → `.claude/consent.json` across
  15 files
- Copied `handoff-test` skill from `package/.claude/skills/` to
  `.claude/skills/` (dev mirror)
- Replaced `grep -oP` (Perl regex, fails on BSD/macOS) with portable
  `sed -n` in `package/.claude/hooks/session-start.sh`

This branch already has one commit (`7201af0`: switch current-state.md
template from markdown table to YAML). The work in this plan adds to
that branch.

This plan covers all remaining items. The README edits are
interdependent (new sections reference each other), so they're planned
as a single coordinated pass.

## 1. License file (B1)

**Decision needed from Hart.** Present options in layman's terms:

- **MIT** — "Anyone can use, copy, modify, sell. They just have to
  include your copyright notice. Most popular open-source license.
  Used by React, Node, Rails." Pick this if you want maximum adoption.
- **Apache 2.0** — Like MIT but also includes a patent grant (protects
  users from patent claims) and requires stating changes. Pick this if
  you want corporate-friendly with slightly more protection.
- **GPL v3** — Anyone can use and modify, but if they distribute a
  modified version they must also open-source it under GPL. Pick this
  if you want to ensure derivatives stay open.
- **Proprietary / All Rights Reserved** — No one can use without your
  permission. Pick this if you want to control distribution.

**Decision: GPL v3.** Derivatives must stay open-source. This means
anyone can use and modify maestro, but if they distribute a modified
version they must also open-source it under GPL v3.

**Action:** Create `LICENSE` at repo root with standard GPL v3 text.
Copyright line: `Copyright (C) 2026 Hart Phoenix`.

## 2. Learning loop section (B2)

**What:** Add a new `## The learning loop` section after "Quick start"
(before "Update"). This is the unified explanation of how the cycle
works.

**Content structure:**

```
## The learning loop

The harness improves your profile every time you use it. Here's the
cycle:

1. **Work** — use Claude Code normally in any project
2. **Review** — run `/session-review` when you finish a work session.
   It analyzes what you did, quizzes you on 4-6 concepts, and updates
   your scores and gap classifications.
3. **Plan** — next time you start working, `/startwork` reads your
   updated state and proposes what to focus on. It runs automatically
   at session start via the hook, or invoke it directly.
4. **Reflect** — after 3+ sessions, `/startwork` automatically
   dispatches `/progress-review` to detect cross-session patterns:
   stalls, regressions, goal drift, arc readiness. You can also run
   `/progress-review` directly anytime.

The more sessions you complete, the sharper the system gets. Concept
scores are quiz-verified, not self-reported — so the profile converges
on reality.
```

**Also:** Remove the three bullet points under "### 3. Start working"
(starting with "Skills activate contextually" through "Your profile
sharpens over time"). Replace with a forward-reference:
"See **The learning loop** below."

---

## 3. Skills table (B3)

**What:** Replace the current `## Skills included` table with a
categorized table. All 8 skills. No "how to call" column since all
use `/skill-name`. Add a note about auto-dispatch.

**Structure:**

```
## Skills

All skills are invoked with `/skill-name` in Claude Code.

### Core loop

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **intake** | Onboarding interview — bootstraps your profile from background materials and conversation |
| **session-review** | End-of-session analysis, quiz, and learning state update |
| **startwork** | Session planner — reads your state and proposes what to focus on |
| **progress-review** | Cross-session pattern analysis — detects stalls, regressions, and goal drift |

### Working tools

| Skill | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| **quick-ref** | Fast, direct answers. Flags structural gaps in one sentence. |
| **debugger** | Visibility-first debugging — gets the full error before guessing |
| **lesson-scaffold** | Restructures learning materials around what you already know |
| **handoff-test** | Audits your work artifacts for self-containedness before context is lost |

### Automatic dispatch

Some skills run automatically without you invoking them:

- **startwork** dispatches **progress-review** when 3+ sessions have
  accumulated since the last review
- The **session-start hook** checks your learning state and suggests
  `/intake` if you haven't run it, or `/startwork` if your profile
  is stale
- **quick-ref** and **debugger** activate contextually based on what
  you're doing — no slash command needed
```

---

## 4. Undocumented features (B4)

**What:** Add brief documentation for 6 features that exist in code
but aren't in the README.

**Where:** New subsection `## Under the hood` after the skills section.

```
## Under the hood

These files are created and managed by skills during normal use.
You don't need to touch them, but knowing they exist helps if you're
debugging or customizing.

| File | Created by | Purpose |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `learning/session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` | session-review | One file per reviewed session. YAML frontmatter + markdown body. |
| `learning/scaffolds/` | lesson-scaffold | Restructured learning materials with concept classifications |
| `learning/relationships.md` | intake (if opted in) | Teacher/mentor handles and signal repo config |
| `learning/.intake-notes.md` | intake | Resume checkpoint if intake is interrupted mid-interview |
| `learning/.progress-review-log.md` | progress-review | Tracks review windows and deferred findings |

### Session-start hook

When you open Claude Code, a hook runs automatically. It checks:

- Whether you've run `/intake` yet (suggests it if not)
- Whether a previous `/intake` was interrupted (offers to resume)
- Whether your learning profile is stale (suggests `/startwork`)
- Whether harness updates are available (if `"updates": "notify"`)
```

## 5. Data sharing section update (Option B + W3)

**What:** Rewrite the `## Data sharing (optional)` section to:
1. Explain that signal dispatch is currently one-way (option B)
2. Explain that `hartphoenix/maestro-signals` is the developer's repo
   for feedback that improves the harness code
3. Note that teacher response loop is designed and coming

**Replacement content:**

```
## Data sharing (optional)

During `/intake`, you'll be asked if you want to share learning data
to GitHub. One question, one consent. If you opt in:

**Developer signals** — at the end of each `/session-review`, a short
signal is posted to the developer's repo (`hartphoenix/maestro-signals`)
with your feedback on how the tool worked, plus learning metrics
(concept scores, gap types, progress patterns). This data helps improve
the harness — it's how bugs get found and skills get sharpened. You see
every signal before it sends and approve or skip each one.

**Progress repo** — a public GitHub repo is created on your account
(`your-username/learning-signals`). When you run `/progress-review`,
a summary posts there. Teachers, mentors, or peers can watch the repo
and comment with guidance.

**What's shared:** concept scores, gap types, progress patterns, goals,
and growth edges.
**What's never shared:** conversation content, code, file paths,
background materials, or raw quiz answers.

**Current status:** Signal dispatch (you → developer) works now.
The teacher response loop (teacher comments → surfaced in your next
`/startwork`) is designed and coming in a future update. For now,
teacher feedback works through normal GitHub issue comments — you'll
see it when you check your progress repo.

**To invite a teacher:** send them your progress repo link. They Watch
it on GitHub. Add their GitHub handle to `learning/relationships.md`
and `/progress-review` will assign issues to them automatically.

To opt out of all data sharing, delete `.claude/consent.json`.
```

## 6. Troubleshooting section (W5)

**What:** Brief troubleshooting section after "Everything is editable."

```
## Troubleshooting

**Intake interrupted mid-interview:** Run `/intake` again. It detects
the interrupted state and offers to resume where you left off.

**Skills not activating:** Run `bash ~/maestro/scripts/bootstrap.sh`
to re-register. Bootstrap is idempotent — safe to run multiple times.

**Session-review says no learning state:** Run `/intake` first. The
review needs the profile that intake creates.

**Update check not working:** Verify your maestro directory is a git
repo with a remote: `cd ~/maestro && git remote -v`. The hook fetches
in the background — it won't block your session.
```

---

## 7. Platform note

**What:** Add one line to Prerequisites noting platform support.

After the prerequisites list, add:

```
Tested on macOS. Linux should work — all scripts use portable bash
and POSIX utilities. Windows users: use WSL.
```

---

## File changes summary

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `LICENSE` | New file — chosen license text |
| `package/README.md` | Sections 2-7 above (learning loop, skills table, under the hood, data sharing rewrite, troubleshooting, platform note) |

---

## Post-execution

Already persisted at `design/package-prep.md`.

## Verification

1. Read the final README top to bottom — confirm it flows linearly
   for a new user (install → intake → work → review → plan → reflect)
2. Verify all 8 skills appear in the skills table
3. Verify all 6 undocumented features appear in "Under the hood"
4. Grep for "feedback.json" — confirm zero results (already done)
5. Confirm data sharing section mentions `hartphoenix/maestro-signals`
   by name and explains it's for developer improvement
6. Confirm option B language is honest about one-way dispatch
