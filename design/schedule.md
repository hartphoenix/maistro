## Milestones

| Day | Target | Status |
|-----|--------|--------|
| Mon 2/23 | PRD submitted. Group pitch sent. Both repos scaffolded. Coordination layer extraction started. | Done |

| End-to-end test: clone → /intake → work → /session-review → signal | Not run |

### Validation experiments

See `design/validation-plan.md` for full specs. All designed, none run.

| Experiment | Priority |
|------------|----------|
| Retrospective compliance audit | 1 (highest info yield) |
| A/B testing infrastructure | 2 (enables experiments 3, 7) |
| First-person framing | 3 |
| Instruction persistence | 4 (can run with #2) |
| Context budget measurement + skill audit | 5 |
| Embedding loop validation | 6 |
| Onboarding design | 7 (deployment-blocking) |
| Continuous system observability (7b) | 0 (prerequisite — makes 5, 6, 7 cheaper) |
| Context budget discipline | 8 (deployment-blocking) |
| SessionStart hook validation | 9 (run with peer testing) |

## Definition of Done

From `design/prd.md`, updated to reflect P10:

- A non-Hart developer can install the personal harness and have a
  working, personalized setup within 15–20 minutes
- A team of 2+ can install the coordination layer and have working task
  selection, triage, and dependency tracking within 30 minutes
- Both tools have a README with quickstart
- Demo shows both working and self-improving — with at least one other
  person's real usage as evidence
- Demo shows the teacher-student exchange: a progress review published
  via GitHub Issues, a teacher response, and that response surfaced in
  the student's next startwork session
