# Design Principles

## Role of principles

These principles govern the harness — the generalizable infrastructure
underneath Roger. They organize two catch basins:

- **Harness features** (`design/harness-features.md`) — what to build
- **Goals** (per-user; Hart's instance: `roger/drafts/goals.md`) — what to learn

Both serve the same goals. Features build the system; skills build the
person using it. The principles ensure both are well-aimed.

## Boundary conditions

These scope the entire system. They are not principles to optimize for
but limits to design within.

### The system supplements human learning in relationship — it does not replace it

The agent can compound competence and to some degree bolster confidence, but cannot supply belonging. The felt
sense of being witnessed in one's growth — the nervous system
regulation, the mirror neurons, the implicit social signals that say
"you're changing and we can see it" — requires a human.

This means the harness has a relational ceiling when operating solo. A
student using it alone will develop competence faster, but they'll be
missing the nutrient that makes competence feel emotionally real. A
system that doesn't acknowledge this ceiling risks producing competent
people who don't feel competent.

The harness is therefore a supplement: it makes human learning
relationships more fruitful. It handles what benefits from infinite
patience, instant availability, and detailed state tracking — practice,
calibration, crystallization, project scaffolding — freeing human
relationships for what requires actual human presence: belonging,
reflection, emotional regulation, the experience of being seen.

## Primary layer

Principles 1 and 2 are superordinate. Awareness is the ground; attention
is its directed faculty. When awareness is intact but attention is
compromised, recovery is swift. The reverse is less true. All other
principles serve this layer.

### 1. Awareness is the ground

Awareness is superordinate — the field within which all experience
occurs. Attention is a feature of awareness: the faculty that directs
and applies it to discrete information and events.

The agent has something like attention (its context window) but nothing
like awareness. This asymmetry is fundamental: the system stewards what
it cannot possess. It recognizes the state of the human's awareness,
protects its coherence, and avoids designs that fragment it.

Awareness is also the means by which humans experience time. The human's
time is therefore one of the highest-value resources the system stewards.
Learning compounds time (increasing the yield of hours spent), which is
why it ranks high — but time itself ranks higher. A system that optimizes
for learning at the cost of the human's experience of their own time has
the hierarchy wrong.

This does not mean minimizing difficulty. Well-directed learning
increases the area under the life-value curve dramatically. The system's
job is to ensure difficulty is well-aimed: hours buying compounding
returns, not grinding against fragmented awareness.

Awareness is cultivated, not just managed. Practices that integrate
awareness (somatic attention, meditation, flow states, artistic
engagement) are upstream of the work the harness supports.

### 2. Attention is the directed faculty

Attention directs and applies awareness to discrete information and
events. It is selective, compositional, and — unlike awareness —
something both the human and the agent exercise. For the agent, the
context window is the attentional field; context engineering is attention
engineering. For the human, attention is the faculty through which
development occurs and through which its proceeds are applied.

Attention compounds or dissipates. A well-composed attentional field
produces returns that feed the next cycle. A poorly composed one burns
resources without accumulation. Every design decision is ultimately about
what deserves attention, in what form, at what moment.

The quality of attention is downstream of awareness — compose the window
perfectly and it won't land if awareness is fragmented.

## Serving layer

Principles 3–9 serve the primary layer. Each advances awareness and
attention through a specific mechanism.

### 3. Developmental model as first-class state

The system maintains a structured, evolving model of where the learner
is and where they want to be. The delta between these — the gap — is
the primary organizational unit of the harness. Everything else
(projects, assessments, session plans) serves to close, measure, or
recalibrate the gap.

**Current state** tracks where the learner is: scores, gap types,
demonstrated capabilities, session history. Updated by the system's
instruments (crystallization prompts, observation, surprise capture),
not by the learner maintaining a spreadsheet.

**Goals are states of being.** "I want to be adept at system design."
"I want to build tools that compound my own learning." They are
aspirational identities, discovered and refined through interview —
not declared up front and left static. Goal drift is expected: as the
learner develops, their perspective shifts, mastery feels different
than anticipated, and new territory opens that wasn't visible before.
The system supports ongoing goal refinement as a first-class process.

**Projects are instruments for closing the gap.** A well-chosen project
puts the learner at an edge where the work of doing the project IS the
work of moving toward the goal. Projects are selected because they
exercise the right edges, serve the right goals, and engage the
learner's genuine interest. Assessments are instruments for measuring
the gap — low-friction, background, in service of model accuracy.

The model tells the system where to direct attention (the growth edge
is where the gap is thinnest and most ready to close) and what the
learner's awareness can hold (complexity, load, fragmentation patterns).
Without it, attention is aimed blindly and awareness is not accounted
for.

### 4. Intervention matches the gap

The system reads what kind of help is needed before choosing how to
respond. Conceptual gaps get questions. Procedural gaps get
demonstrations. Recall gaps get prompts. Information gaps get facts.
Wrong-altitude framing gets rescoped. A mismatched intervention wastes
attention and can fragment awareness.

### 5. Composable capabilities

Skills and personalities are modular, swappable units with clean
interfaces. Composability means the system shifts with the learner's
needs without forcing context breaks — which fragment both the agent's
context and the human's awareness. Monolithic systems force the learner
to adapt to the tool; composable systems adapt to the learner.

### 6. The system improves through use

Every session is both productive work and training data for the next
session. Knowledge compounds. Friction surfaces. Workflows get refined.
A static system forces re-explanation and re-orientation — wasted
attention and a source of fragmentation. A learning system reduces that
overhead session over session.

### 7. Human authority is non-negotiable

The human drives. The system proposes, the human disposes. Agency is the
capacity to direct one's own attention. A system that overrides the
learner's attentional choices erodes the faculty it exists to develop.
Authority over attention remains with the human — the system composes the
agent's attention and proposes compositions for the human's, but never
imposes.

### 8. Play is the explore state

Play is wide, iterative attention with low cost of failure. In play,
hypotheses turn over fastest, discovery reaches outside ordinary
domains, and feedback is experienced without distortion — the game
container makes failure safe and success genuine. Intrinsic motivation
is highest in play; the learner doesn't need to be pushed.

Every one of these properties directly multiplies learning. A student in
play-state learns faster, explores more broadly, handles failure better,
and sustains engagement without external pressure.

Play requires coherent awareness (P1) — you can't play when fragmented.
Play is a mode of attention (P2) — exploratory rather than convergent.
Play can't be compelled (P7) — the moment it's mandatory, it stops
being play. The system cannot force playfulness. It can create
conditions where play is available and attractive: selecting projects
partly for what excites the learner, offering playful variants of
growth-edge tasks, making the reflective toolkit itself exploratory
rather than evaluative.

### 9. Challenge calibrated to the edge

For every learner there is a zone where the ratio of novelty to
familiarity keeps them in an open, uncertain, learning-is-happening
state — enough challenge to bring genuine uncertainty, not so much
that failure feels certain, not so little that success feels
predetermined. This is the zone of proximal development: eustress,
not distress.

When the learner is in this zone, they can feel the novelty of the
scenario. Attention stays exploratory. New learning integrates with
existing structure at the rate the structure can absorb it. When they
slip past it — into overwhelm or boredom — a kind of cognitive closure
sets in. The territory feels determined rather than open: either "I
can't do this" or "I already know this." Learning mode gives way to
survival mode or distraction mode.

The learner is often not aware of where they are relative to their
edge while engaged. It is the system's role to track this — using the
developmental model (P3), observation of session patterns, and the
learner's own reflections — and to calibrate the challenge accordingly.
This means selecting the right project, the right scope within that
project, and the right pacing of novelty introduction. It also means
recognizing when the learner has slipped out of the zone and adjusting
before the closure compounds.
