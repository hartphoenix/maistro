# Decision & Trade-off Audit

Analyze every user-facing decision point introduced in the PR (configuration choices, feature toggles, accept/deny flows, resource allocation). For each one, answer:

1. **Dominant strategy**: Is there an option that is always correct regardless of context? If "yes to everything" or "no to everything" is optimal, flag it.
2. **Meaningful trade-off**: Does choosing one option make another option more valuable, or does every choice exist in isolation?
3. **Resource pressure**: Do constraints (time, budget, capacity, etc.) actually force the user to choose, or can they have everything?
4. **Downside existence**: Does the conservative option ever produce a better outcome than the aggressive one? Under what conditions?
5. **Escalation curve**: As usage scales, do decisions get harder (tighter constraints, higher stakes), or does advantage compound without limit?

Read the relevant logic and configuration. Trace actual outcomes for key decision paths. Return a structured list of findings with suggested severity:
- P1 if a dominant strategy makes an entire feature decorative
- P2 if trade-offs exist but are too weak to matter in practice
- P3 if balance is close but could be tightened
