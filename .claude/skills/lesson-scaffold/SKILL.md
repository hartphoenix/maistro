name: lesson-scaffold
description: Restructures external learning materials into a conceptual scaffold tailored to the learner's current level. Reads learning state (current-state, goals, session logs) to classify concepts and shape the scaffold. Writes a persistent scaffold file to learning/scaffolds/. Use when the user provides learning materials and wants to understand the "why" before executing.

# Lesson Scaffold

Restructure what someone else organized by procedure into what the
learner needs organized by understanding. The learner's current state
drives the scaffold — it determines which concepts get emphasis,
where the bridges are, and what gaps need attention.

## Inputs

1. **Source material** (required). URL, file path, or pasted text — any
   learning content.
2. **Context** (optional). Energy, time, emotional context, what they
   need. Shapes scope.

## Phase 1: Gather

Read local learning state. Fail fast and degrade gracefully — every
source is optional.

### Step 1: Learning state check

Check whether `learning/current-state.md` and `learning/goals.md` exist.

- **Both exist:** Full gather. Proceed normally.
- **Some exist:** Work with what's available. Silent.
- **None exist:** Tell the user: "No learning profile found — I'll
  scaffold from the material alone. Run `/intake` for a personalized
  scaffold." Proceed with concepts classified as new.

### Step 2: Recent session context

List files in `learning/session-logs/`. For the most recent 1-2 log
files, read the YAML frontmatter. Extract:

```yaml
date: YYYY-MM-DD
project: project-name
concepts:
  - name: concept-name
    score: N
    gap: type
arcs:
  - arc-name
```

Also scan the body of the most recent log for "remaining work" or
"next steps" — material that connects to unfinished threads gets
extra relevance.

From the collected frontmatter, build a picture of:
- **Recent concepts and scores** — what was just reviewed and where
  gaps remain
- **Arcs touched recently** — which developmental lines are active
- **Unfinished threads** — remaining work that the material might
  connect to

If no session logs exist, skip silently.

### Step 3: Learning state files

If the learning state files exist, read them:

**`learning/current-state.md`** — concept inventory. Extract:
- Concept scores — focus on concepts relevant to the source material
- Gap types — conceptual vs. procedural vs. recall informs how to
  scaffold each concept
- Evidence sources — quiz-verified scores carry more weight than
  estimates (see `.claude/references/scoring-rubric.md`)

**`learning/goals.md`** — active goals. Extract:
- Goal aspirations and capabilities required
- Which goals the source material serves

Reference files consulted as needed:
- `.claude/references/scoring-rubric.md` for score interpretation
- `.claude/references/developmental-model.md` for ordering heuristic

## Phase 2: Analyze and Scaffold

### Step 1: Fetch the source material

Read or fetch the source material provided by the user.

### Step 2: Extract concepts

Extract every concept the material teaches or assumes — explicit and
implicit. Implicit concepts (things the lesson takes for granted) are
often where the real learning edges are.

### Step 3: Classify each concept using gathered state

For each extracted concept, assign a classification:

- **Solid** (score ≥ 4 in current-state) — use as anchor. Bridge new
  concepts to these. Brief mention only.
- **Growing** (score 2-3) — reinforcement opportunity. Note the gap
  type: conceptual gaps need framing, procedural gaps need reps,
  recall gaps need spaced exposure.
- **New** (not in current-state) — new territory. Connect to the
  nearest known concept as a bridge.
- **Prerequisite gap** (score ≤ 1, or missing but the material assumes
  it) — flag as risk. Suggest pre-work or flag for extra attention
  during execution.

If no learning state exists, classify all concepts as new.

### Step 4: Connect to goals

If `learning/goals.md` exists, note:
- Which goals does this material serve?
- Which arcs does it touch?
- One sentence connecting the material to the learner's trajectory.

### Step 5: Produce the scaffold

Six sections, each shaped by the concept classifications:

**What this material covers** — one paragraph connecting the material
to the learner's goals and current state. What it teaches, why it
matters now.

**Concepts to understand** — each concept with:
- Classification (solid / growing / new / prerequisite gap)
- A one-sentence bridge to something the learner already knows
- For growing concepts: note the gap type
- For prerequisite gaps: flag the risk

**Execution sequence** — the instructor's steps reordered by
conceptual dependency. Group steps that share a concept. Mark which
concepts each step exercises. Weight time toward growing and new
concepts — solid concepts need less attention.

**Resurfaced gaps** — low-scoring concepts from current-state.md that
this material happens to touch. Spaced repetition for free.

**Goal connection** — one line: what this material moves forward in
the learner's trajectory.

**Pre-work** (only if prerequisite gaps were found) — specific
concepts to review or brush up on before starting.

### Step 6: Write the scaffold file

Write the scaffold to `learning/scaffolds/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic-slug>.md`.

Derive the topic slug from the source material title, URL path, or
filename. If the `learning/scaffolds/` directory doesn't exist, create
it.

**File format:**

```markdown
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
source: <URL, file path, or "pasted text">
arcs: [list of arcs this material touches]
concepts: [list of concepts extracted]
---

# Scaffold: <topic>

## What this material covers
<paragraph connecting to learner's goals>

## Concepts
<classified concept list with bridges, gaps, and status>

## Execution sequence
<reordered steps grouped by concept, weighted toward growth edges>

## Resurfaced gaps
<low-scoring concepts this material touches>

## Goal connection
<one line: what this moves forward>

## Pre-work
<only if prerequisite gaps found>
```

### Step 7: Link to session log

Check whether `learning/session-logs/YYYY-MM-DD.md` exists for today.

**If it exists:** add a `scaffold:` field to its YAML frontmatter
pointing to the scaffold file.

**If it doesn't exist:** create it with minimal frontmatter:

```yaml
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
scaffold: scaffolds/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic-slug>.md
---
```

This creates a breadcrumb so session-review can connect the scaffold's
predictions to session evidence. Session-review will merge its own
frontmatter (project, concepts, arcs) into this file later — don't
duplicate those fields here.

### Step 8: Present and confirm

Present the scaffold to the user. Ask whether the scope and
classification feel right. If they adjust, update the file.

They drive.

## Graceful Degradation

| Missing | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| All learning state | Scaffold from material alone. All concepts classified as new. Suggest `/intake`. |
| `current-state.md` only | No concept scoring. Goals still provide trajectory connection. |
| `goals.md` only | No trajectory connection. Concepts still scored from current-state. |
| Session logs empty | No recent session context. Scaffold still works. |

Never error on missing data. Shape the scaffold to available data.
Only surface a message when the degradation meaningfully changes what
the skill can offer.

## Anti-Patterns

- **Don't execute the assignment.** Scaffold is for understanding, not
  walkthrough.
- **Don't teach the concepts yet.** Name and bridge them. Teaching
  happens during execution.
- **Don't skip implicit concepts.** Procedural lessons bury
  assumptions.
- **Don't ignore emotional context.** "I'm tired" is load-bearing
  information about session scope.
- **Don't update learning state.** Lesson-scaffold does not modify
  concept scores, gaps, or arc state. It writes to
  `learning/scaffolds/` and may add a `scaffold:` field to session log
  frontmatter (Step 7), but session-review owns all state updates.
